Project Tracking
================

The main purpose of the *project* module is to track contexts of
project-based business activities and collaboration.

**Projects** can be both multi-location and multi-organisation,
through qualified links describing exactly how the respective
location or organisation is involved.

**Activities** represent concrete actions within a project, with
place, time and type.

Various categories are available for both activities and projects,
e.g. themes, sectors, and hazards addressed.

Additionally, the module provides a basic **task** management, which
can also be used standalone for simple TODO lists.
