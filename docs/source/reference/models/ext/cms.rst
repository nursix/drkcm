Content Management
==================

The Content Management System (*cms*) is a place to store all kinds of
user-editable contents. Its main entity is the **Post** (=content item),
which can be linked to various :doc:`core entities <../core/index>`.
Posts are also *DocEntities*, i.e. can have attachments.
